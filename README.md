Generic Reporting Framework
===========================

This provides EPrints with a generic framework to generate reports. The work is based on the REF2014 plug-in, which has been generalised.

This package provides only the framework and no reports. It contains:

- basic configuration to enable Reports
- template Screen plug-in which displays a Report
- template Export plug-ins which may be used by a Report (for instance if the data must be formatted to CSV, XML,... which can then be imported into an external service)
